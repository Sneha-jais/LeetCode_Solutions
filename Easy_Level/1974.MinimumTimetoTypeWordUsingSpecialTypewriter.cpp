/*
There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z' arranged in a circle with a pointer. 
A character can only be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is initially pointing to the character 'a'.
Input: word = "abc"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The characters are printed as follows:
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
